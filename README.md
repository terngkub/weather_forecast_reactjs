# weather_forecast_reactjs
Weather forecast webapp in react.js

### About this project
This is a weather forecase webapp for city in USA. You can type a city name and enter to see the temperature, humidity and pressure of that city for 5 days. The weather data are showed in graph and the city is showed by Google Maps location. I learned this from an online course ["Tutorial: Intro To React"](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux). In this project, I learn about react.js, redux, OpenWeatherMap API, Google Maps API and also drawing a graph using sparkline.
